It is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large datasets.

For example, the rule {onions, potatoes}--->{burger} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat.

Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements.
The dataset includes 7501 transactions and each entry records items bought by a customer.
